### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p><a href="https://lukaszdzielo.github.io">Website</a></p>

<p>I have been dealing with websites since 2012. Initially as a graphic designer, and until today as a Front-end. In my work Im guided by the code simplicity and consistency, always adjusting to the vision of my Client. Im working on upgrading my qualifications so prospectively I will learn JS to fulfill the expectations of my Clients.</p>

<p>Mainly companies for which I provide services work on Bootstrap, so and everything that others do in Javascript, I make up for it using SCSS and HTML. I mainly get a graphic design and cut it to a clean code, and then it is hooked up to a dedicated CMS system. I also worked on Wordpress using Enfold, Divi, Bridge and Jupiter. Learning Vue and React is my goal for the near future.</p>
